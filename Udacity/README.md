 - Project 1: Weather Trends. \
 To explore weather trends, I analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends.

 - Project 2: Investigate No-show appointments from Kaggle. \
 This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row. I conduct my own data analysis, brainstorm potential questions, and utilize pandas and NumPy to answer the questions.

- Project 3: Analyze A/B Test Results. \
 An e-commerce company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. The goal is to help the company to understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.


- Project 4: Wrangle and Analyze Twitter Data. \
The goal of this projec is to wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information. Additional gathering using url as well as Twitter API, then assessing to define data quality and tidiness issues and cleaning them for analyses and visualizations.


- Project 5: Communicate Data Findings. \
Use Python visualization libraries, including matplotlib and seaborn, to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. Then, produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in your selected dataset.
